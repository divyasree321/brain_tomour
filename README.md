# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project implements a brain tumor detection system using MRI images and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in **Google Colab**.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- MRI image preprocessing
- CNN model construction
- Training and evaluation of the model
- Visualization of training/validation accuracy and loss

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The trained CNN model successfully classifies MRI images into tumor and non-tumor classes, with evaluation metrics visualized via accuracy and loss plots.

## ðŸ“š File Included
- `brain_tumour.ipynb` : Google Colab notebook with the full code and outputs.

## ðŸ”— How to Run
- Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
- Upload or link the dataset
- Run all cells in order
